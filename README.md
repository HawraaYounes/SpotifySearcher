# Spotify Artist Search Application

## Overview

This project is a basic Spotify application built using ReactJS for the frontend. The main objective of this app is to allow users to search for an artist, view detailed information about their albums, and explore their discography. The project demonstrates my skills in React development, particularly in creating a dynamic and responsive user interface that interacts with an external API.

## Features

- **React Essentials**: The project demonstrates key React concepts including:
  - **Components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable, independent pieces.
  - **Props and State**: Managing data flow and user interactions within the app.
  - **React Router**: Navigating between the artist search and album browsing pages.
- **Spotify API Integration**:
  - **Artist Search**: Users can search for artists using the Spotify API.
  - **Artist Information**: Display artist details including image, popularity, and followers.
  - **Album Browsing**: View an artist's albums with details such as album cover, release year, and tracklist.
  - **Spotify Previews**: Provide clickable links to preview albums directly on Spotify.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application adapts seamlessly to different devices.
- **Bonus Feature**:
  - **Search-as-You-Type**: Implemented a dynamic search that displays results as the user types.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **ReactJS**: Used for building the frontend components and managing state.
  - **Bootstrap**: Utilized for styling the app interface and ensuring responsive design.
